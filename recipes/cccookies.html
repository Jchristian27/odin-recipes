    <h2>A chocolate chip cookie is a sweet baked treat that is recognized by its butter flavor and the inclusion of chocolate chips.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
      <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
      <li>Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
      <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour. </li>
      <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li>
      <li>Stir in the chocolate chips</li>
      <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
    </ol>
